## Small Container Storage System

This modular storage system is designed for use with a specific transparent box sold in Japan. Availability outside Japan is uncertain, but feel free to contact us if you're interested—we may be able to arrange something.
The system consists of two main components:
1.	Small Storage Boxes – Fit inside the transparent container.
2.	Vertical/Horizontal Storage System – Organizes and secures the containers efficiently.
________________________________________
## 1. Small Storage Boxes
The main transparent container is divided into a 5×7 grid.
To start, print the “Sikiri Base Frame Circle”, which locks the small boxes in place and prevents movement when the container is closed.
The small storage boxes come in various sizes, from 1×1 up to 7×5, allowing you to customize the layout to your needs.
Key features:
•	Lipped edges for easy lifting and labeling.
•	Reinforced structure for added durability.
•	Stackable design, even when combining different sizes.

## 2. Storage System
This system allows you to store the transparent boxes vertically. The main component is the “Sikiri Carrier”, which can be stacked and interlocked securely.
🔹 Structural Features:
•	Vertical holes (7.2mm diameter) to insert M6 or M5 rods for added stability, weight distribution, and prevention of lower-level compression.
•	Mounting options: Can be secured to a shelf or table with screws.
🔹 Required Parts for a Complete Tower:
•	“Sikiri Carrier Foot 2” – Base of the tower, with space for long nuts to fix rods.
•	“Sikiri Carrier” – Main stacking unit; print as many as needed for your desired height. Ca. 28 for 1 m height.
•	“Sikiri Carrier Junction” – Connects two rods when building very tall towers.
•	“Sikiri Carrier Top” – Secures the top of the tower; small nuts can be added for extra stability.
•	“Sikiri Carrier Nut Cover (Front & Back)” – Cosmetic covers for the nuts on top.
🔹 Additional Variants & Connectors:
•	No-Nut Version – Designed for direct attachment to shelves or tables.
•	Double-Height Version – Holds two transparent containers; useful for future expansions.
•	No-Hole Version – A cleaner design without side holes if connectors aren’t needed.
🔹 Connector Options:
•	“Plug Connector Screw M10” & “Plug Connector Base with M10 Hole” – Joins two carriers horizontally.
•	“Plug Connector Screw 4mm” – Attaches a carrier to a surface without spacing.
•	Spacer Connectors: 
o	“Plug connector Screw 4mm – 6mm”, combined with “ConterPlug connector screw 4mm” and “Plug connector Screw 4mm – 13mm”, combined with “ConterPlug screw 4mm” can be used to attach a carrier to a surface, but on a distance of 4,6 mm. 
o	These are useful when mounting on uneven or non-horizontal surfaces.

## Print Settings
These parts can be printed with 3-4 walls and 20% infill. The small boxes themselves have 2 perimeter-thick walls, using a 0.4mm nozzle.

## Additional Hardware
As an example, for a 2m height tower, you need:
•	4 × 2m M6 or M5 rods
•	4 × 30mm M6 or M5 nuts
•	4 × M6 or M5 nuts
Alternatively, if only 1m length rods are available:
•	8 × 1m M6 or M5 rods
•	8 × 30mm M6 or M5 nuts
•	4 × M6 or M5 nuts

This storage system offers flexibility, stability, and customization to fit your needs. Let us know if you have any questions or specific requirements! 😊
