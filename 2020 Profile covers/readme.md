## Introducing Improved Slot Covers

Hey everyone,

If you’re tired of dirt and those annoying small filament pieces getting into your slots, I’ve got something you’ll love—improved slot covers! Once you start using them, you won't want to stop.

After experimenting with different existing printed slot covers, I decided to create a new, more reliable design. The usual covers often break upon insertion, making them pretty useless. My design addresses this issue, making the covers easier to insert and remove while preventing breakage. Check out the details in the “2020 Extrusion Slot Cover.pdf.” Although it might seem a bit overengineered, it doesn’t use much more filament than the usual covers.

## How to Print

Before committing to a larger print, it's crucial to test the fit since not all profiles are the same. Variations can occur due to slight differences in aluminum extrusion dies or paint thickness. Here's a quick guide:

1. Test Print: Start with a 50 or 100 mm part and test it on your extrusion. If it’s too loose or too tight, adjust the width and/or height in the slicer until it fits perfectly. My parts are optimized for LDO 2020 extrusions, but adjustments might be necessary.

2. Final Print: Once you’ve dialed in the correct width and height, measure the length you need. The standard lengths available are 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 mm, but you can scale them up or down by ±50 mm. For example, if you need a 358 mm cover, use a 400 mm model and scale it down to 358 mm. This ensures all features of the design work as intended.

3. Printing Settings: I use the PIF Standard, but any setting with two or more external walls should work fine since the parts aren’t large.

With these new slot covers, you can keep your extrusions clean and functional without the frustration of breakage. Happy printing!
